# LinkedIn
A repository for sharing my projects on LinkedIn

This project accompanies one of my earliest post on medium.com. It's a data analysis project that breaks down a ChatGPT response about a pro sports compensation topic. 

Feel free to download all the files if you have docker. Everything is ready to go. 

Also feel free to just download the Jupyter notebook file and/or the requirements.txt file based on how confident you are that you have what you need in your local environment. 

If you are super confident that you have what you need, then feel free to comment out the pip install of the requirements.txt file (first cell).

Below is a link to the medium blog post. 

Enjoy!
