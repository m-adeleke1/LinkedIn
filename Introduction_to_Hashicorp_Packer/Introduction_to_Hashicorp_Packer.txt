I have a rudimentary understanding of how Hashicorp Packer works. I'm going to go through this beginner-level project to try to deploy an AMI image onto AWS.

1. Launched an ACloudGuru server. 

Username: [SERVER_USERNAME]
Password: [SERVER_PASSWORD]

Public IP:  [SERVER_PUBLIC_IP]
Private IP: [SERVER_PRIVATE_IP]
IPv6:       [SERVER_IPv6]



2. Ran the code below to install Packer:

sudo yum update -y

wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/packer/1.10.2/packer_1.10.2_linux_amd64.zip

unzip packer_1.10.2_linux_amd64.zip

sudo mv packer /usr/local/bin/

packer version



3. Verified the Packer version

packer version



4. Ran the following commands to create a folder called 'packer-vm', then I created a file within the folder named 'vm.pkr.hcl'.

mkdir packer-vm
cd packer-vm
vim vm.pkr.hcl



5. Started an AWS sandbox

Username:          [SANDBOX_USERNAME]
Password:          [SANDBOX_PASSWORD]
URL:               [SANDBOX_URL]
Access Key:        [SANDBOX_ACCESS_KEY]
Secret Access Key: [SANDBOX_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]



6. Ran 'aws configure' and added the relevant credentials

[[SERVER_USERNAME]@30e886e91d1c packer-vm]$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]:     [SANDBOX_ACCESS_KEY]
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: [SANDBOX_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]
Default region name [None]:   us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json



7. Pasted the code below into the hcl file. I made sure to check for the ami id for the RHEL os for the us-east-1 region. Make sure to check the AMI ID for the region that you are using:


packer {
  required_plugins {
    amazon = {
      source  = "github.com/hashicorp/amazon"
      version = ">= 0.0.1"
    }
  }
}

variable "ami_id" {
  type    = string
  default = "ami-0fe630eb857a6ec83"
}

variable "app_name" {
  type    = string
  default = "httpd"
}

locals {
    app_name = "httpd"
}

source "amazon-ebs" "httpd" {
  ami_name      = "PACKER-DEMO-${local.app_name}"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  region        = "us-east-1"
  source_ami    = "${var.ami_id}"
  ssh_username  = "ec2-user"
  tags = {
    Env  = "DEMO"
    Name = "PACKER-DEMO-${var.app_name}"
  }
}

build {
  sources = ["source.amazon-ebs.httpd"]

  provisioner "shell" {
    script = "script/script.sh"
  }

  post-processor "shell-local" {
    inline = ["echo foo"]
  }
}




8. Made a script.sh file and pasted the relevant code below.

mkdir script && cd script

vim script.sh

#!/bin/bash
sudo yum -y update
sudo yum install -y httpd



9. Ran the code below to init the plugins, validate, and build the packer hcl template

packer init .

packer validate vm.pkr.hcl

packer build vm.pkr.hcl


10. And that's it! I checked the AWS account and there was one terminated instance, one security group and one snapshot. So the packer process deals with provisioning a machine to design and load the custom os image, save that image as a snapshot, and then delete the instance. The software is very useful for customization processes because it can load tools like ansible for custom configuration management. Cool Stuff!
